# This is a mern application with fronend, backend and mongobd 

## Create a network for the docker containers
docker network create demo

## Build the client

cd mern/frontend

docker build -t mern-frontend .

Run the client

docker run --name=frontend --network=demo -d -p 5173:5173 mern-frontend

Verify the client is running
Open your browser and type http://localhost:5173 (in case of EC2 provide the public ip in local host)

## Run the mongodb container
docker run --network=demo --name mongodb -d -p 27017:27017 -v ~/opt/data:/data/db mongodb:latest

## Build the server

cd mern/backend

docker build -t mern-backend .

Run the server

docker run --name=backend --network=demo -d -p 5050:5050 mern-backend

## docker compose 
we have automated the above steps with docker compose file, it will create custome network, build images in front and backend, lauch a db instance along with fron and backend container and connect them in the custome network.

docker-compose up -d


## Problems to be careful
we need to have db container running first before the backend

if we are launching it in ec2 instance, change the localhost to the public ip of the ec2 inside this files
 mern_app/mern/frontend/src/components/Record.yml
 mern_app/mern/frontend/src/components/RecordList.yml

in case of lauching the composed file multiple times, make sure to remove the networks along with the containers and images created by the composed file
